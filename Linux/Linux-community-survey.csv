Finally, Cryptpad is probs not capable of scoring/grading answers, but I do think it's valuable if priorities are better represented.

I didn't switch from Ubuntu, but rather Linux Mint, because I foolishly broke Linux Mint while trying to install Gnome on it, which is unsupported. As far as Wayland goes, it seems most of the issues with it have been fixed. It is now compatible with Nvidia GPUs and supports Sticky Keys. However, I really can't be bothered to make the switch, but when I have to, I certainly will. I also use some X11-only applications (such as xsane) though, so it's not very practical to use Wayland when I'd need to run an X server for xwayland support anyways. As far as flatpak goes, I do have some flatpaks. However, I did a quick 'flatpak list' and noticed that none of the flatpaks I have installed are things I really use anymore. So I won't really need to use Flatpaks in the future. I have no hate for flatpak, I'd just rather get things as native packages as that is the way my OS (Debian) is set up to work. Lastly, as far as proprietary software goes, I don't use any proprietary software on Linux except for Nvidia drivers. I still have a Windows machine for running my proprietary CD ripping program, and for whatever other Windows-only software I might need to run in the future. For those wanting a free software Cd ripping program, check out whipper."
