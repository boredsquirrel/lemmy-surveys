These are the results of a bigger survey posted in various Linux communities on Lemmy.

I wanted to know
- who are these people?
- what are they using?
- do they actually know what they are talking about?
- Is the male/female/other quote really that extreme? (psst, yes it is)
- What distros do they use, did they really all start from Ubuntu?
- What DE or WM do they use, are all on Wayland yet?
- What about proprietary software?
- What about Flatpaks?
